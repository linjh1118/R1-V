We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find AB. AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2. We know AC = 3.0 and BC is the unknown length. We can solve for BC using the Pythagorean theorem: BC^2 = AB^2 - AC^2. BC^2 = 5^2 - 3^2 = 25 - 9 = 16. BC = √16 = 4.0. Now we can find AB: AB = √(AC^2 + BC^2) = √(3^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5.0.\n2. Next, we need to find the length of CD. Since CD is perpendicular to AB, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find CD. CD^2 = AC^2 + BC^2. CD^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25. CD = √25 = 5.0.\n3.
