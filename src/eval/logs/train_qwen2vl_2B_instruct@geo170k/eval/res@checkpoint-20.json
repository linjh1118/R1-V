First, we need to find the length of BC. Since triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O, we can use the property that the angle subtended by a diameter at the circumference is a right angle. Therefore, angle BAC is a right angle, and angle BAC = 90 degrees.\n2. Since AB = AC, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, angle BAC = angle ACB = 90 degrees.\n3. Since angle BAC = 120 degrees, angle ACB = 180 - 120 = 60 degrees.\n4. Since angle ACB = 60 degrees, triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle.\n5. Since triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Therefore, BC = AB = 3.\n6. Since BD is the diameter of circle O, angle ABD = 90 degrees.\n7. Since angle ABD = 90 degrees, triangle ABD is a right triangle.\n8. Since triangle ABD is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of AD. Let AD = x. Then, AD^2 + BD^2 = AB^2. Substituting the given values, we get x^2 + 3^2 = 3^2. Simplifying, we get x^2 + 9 = 9. Subtracting 9 from both sides, we get x^2 = 0.
